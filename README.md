# Planes
The laser cutting designs of 2/3 planes have been lost, but the one that survived has been added to this repo.
One or two planes were built every summer (almost a ritual :) )
Few pictures/videos of the multiple planes: [Flying videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d9GcpucrIIFZHRDml-cg8EpoPLq5DDG-?usp=sharing) and [All media](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KTo0zCweJyZ84fYksaK57Db2VPG2zhLo?usp=sharing)
