# Planes
The laser cutting designs of 2/3 planes have been lost, but the one that survived has been added to this repo.
One or two planes were built every summer (almost a ritual :) )
Few videos of the multiple planes: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d9GcpucrIIFZHRDml-cg8EpoPLq5DDG-?usp=sharing)
